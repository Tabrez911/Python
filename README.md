# Python
Python is a general purpose &amp; high programming language. Python is an interpreted language that means to it runs code one instruction at a time. Python can perform data visualization, data analysis and data manipulation; 
# Numpy and Pandas are some of the libraries used for manipulation.
NumPy is an open source Python package for scientific computing. NumPy supports large, multidimensional arrays and matrices. NumPy is written in Python and C. NumPy arrays are faster compared to Python lists.
Similar to NumPy, Pandas is one of the most widely used python libraries in data science. It provides high-performance, easy to use structures and data analysis tools. Unlike NumPy library which provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, Pandas provides in-memory 2d table object called Dataframe.
